# Assignment 1

My first assignment has 3 parts.

## (a)

Posit Cloud is an online data sharing platform. Now, this platform has a new feature called data collections that provides securely store database credentials.

## (b)

I tought that Python is more like English than any other programming language. However, after learning R, I think R is more English now. The most confusing thing was we use "\<-" instead of "=". The second thing is indexes start at 1 instead of 0. Third thing is, python is designed for general purposes and R designed for analyzing data and the ecosystems change do to that.

## (c)

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data1 <- na_example
data1
sum(is.na(data1))
```

```{r}
data2 <- data1
data2[is.na(data2)]<-0
data2
sum(is.na(data2))
```

```{r}

```
